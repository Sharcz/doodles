      <description>Just saw this excellent post looking at density around transit stations today and though I should pull out some numbers to go with the pretty visuals. And with CensusMapper&amp;rsquo;s new capabilities of populating custom geometries with census data estimates it&amp;rsquo;s super-easy to do.
Population density is only one measure of interest here, job density or amenities density would be others. But for now let&amp;rsquo;s focus on population, so how many people live near the rapid transit stations.</description>
