      <description>Last week my friend Alejandro emailed me some census data. After sitting on it for a couple of days I decided one evening to take a look and map the dissemination areas. The dataset contained 125 fields around housing and income. So I started plucking some of the fields off the table and mapping them.
It did not take long and colorful maps started showing up. Another evening and lots of map layers later I put the Vancouver Census Map online for people interested to look through the census graphs.</description>
