      <description>Motivated by the excellent Washington Post Wonkblog I mapped Vancouver&amp;rsquo;s bike infrastructure. Looks good at first, but when you take out the &amp;lsquo;fake&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Local Street&amp;rdquo; bikeways more in line with Wonkblog&amp;rsquo;s methodology it&amp;rsquo;s looking pretty bleak in large portions of the city.
Of course the devil is in the details and infrastructure cannot just be judged by how it&amp;rsquo;s labeled. If one were to look for 8-80 infrastructure, then the separated lanes would make the cut.</description>
