      <description>After the teardown map that looked at the low end of Vancouver&amp;rsquo;s building stock, a natural question is to look at the high end. Just as before, we are focusing on the (assessed) value of the building relative to the total (assessed) value of land and improvements. We defined &amp;ldquo;highly improved&amp;rdquo; properties to be properties where the ratio is at least 50%, so the building is worth at least as much as the land it is built on.</description>
