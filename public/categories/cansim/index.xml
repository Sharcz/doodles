      <description>Arguments about the adequacy of Vancouver&amp;rsquo;s housing supply have been making the rounds again lately, but I have not found any arguments or analysis that I found sufficiently accurate or thorough. It&amp;rsquo;s an important question, so Fernando, Bryn and I got together to brainstorm how to measure this.
The first step is to estimate supply over time. Then we break down supply into different types and follow it down the road of getting sold, getting occupied by households and translate that into people to match that up to population growth.</description>
