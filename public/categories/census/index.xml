      <description>At CensusMapper, we have come a long way from first dabbling in census data to building out a platform to map data Canada wide, adding the ability to easily drill down into individual census regions, improving mapping efficiency, adding the ability to automatically populate custom geographic data with census variables and adding older census data.
We believe all of these are comparatively small steps compared to the opening up of map making capabilities for everyone that we are rolling out today.</description>
